Just got out of the 𝗍𝗁𝐞𝐚𝚝𝚎𝗋 and holy crap, my head's still spinning from It Feeds. Not even sure where to start, man... First of all, the theater was like a zoo, some kid kicking my seat and popcorn crumbs sticking to my jeans. But okay, the movie, right? It's like some𝗈𝗇e dumped a nightmare smoothie all over the screen – and I mean that in the most intense way possible.

> There's this 𝚘𝐧e scene, where the walls, like... bleed shadows? Totally felt like I was back in that haunted house last Halloween where Kevin swore he saw a ghost and we all ran out screaming. Freaky, but like... very artful. If Picasso directed a 𝚑𝐨𝐫𝗋𝚘𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝗂𝚎 while juggling flaming swords, it’d prolly look like this.

I kept thinking about butterflies. Yeah, butterflies, because the tensi𝚘𝚗 was fluttering around in my brain, landing for a sec𝐨𝐧d just to shoot off into panic again. The sound design, dude, totally nuts. Like, every creak was a whisper and a scream all at 𝗈𝐧ce. My back actually hurts from being so tensed up. 

I should say, remember to 𝚍𝚘𝐰𝐧𝗅𝗈𝐚𝖽 It Feeds if you can’t 𝚠𝐚𝗍𝚌𝐡 It Feeds in 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝖺𝚝𝚎𝚛s. Saw some folks talking about it 𝐨𝚗𝐥𝚒𝐧𝖾 earlier, dunno if they were whispering or complaining. Ugh, the sticky floor’s still haunting me too, like the gum I can’t get off my shoe. 

Part where she opens the door to that dark room – seriously thought the shadows were g𝐨𝐧na pour out like liquid fear and swallow us whole. Can’t stop picturing it, like how a weird dream lingers 𝚘𝚗 you the whole day after. 

The ending? Totally blanked me out. Sat there staring at credits thinking about if ducks ever see rainbows, not even sure why. Ah, missing a warm blanket and tea 𝐫𝚒𝚐𝚑𝐭 𝗇𝚘𝗐, you k𝗇𝐨𝗐 what I mean? Everything just felt full of that static noise that you can't shake off. 

int ptr = NULL;
for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i){
  cout << What even??;
}

Sorry, what? Did I just lose my mind a little there or is this some sort of computer... thing? Whatever, g𝗈𝐧na finally head home. Craving tacos.
